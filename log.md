# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Sabrina Samuel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 22nd, Sunday, 2019].

### R2D1: September 22, 2019
Worked on Resistor Color and RNA Transcription exercises on Exercism Javascript track

**Thoughts:** These were exercises that I started during my first round but didn't finish. I found that coming back to it with fresh eyes and some different ideas. We shall see if I need to rework either of them, after mentor feedback.

### R2D2: September 23, 2019
Worked on Javascript exercises on Codewars

**Thoughts:** 
One of the exercises didn't have clear instructions so it wasn't until I ran the tests, that I understood what other things they were looking for. A bit frustrating to not have it clear enough.

1. [Square(n) Sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/square-n-sum/javascript)
2. [Difference of Volumes of Cuboids](https://www.codewars.com/kata/difference-of-volumes-of-cuboids/javascript)

### R2D11: October 8, 2019
Worked on Rock, Paper, Scissors project with HTML, CSS and Javascript

**Thoughts:**
Couldn't doing any coding, the last couple of days, due to other commitments and travelling. Decided to work on a Rock, Paper, Scissors project that was loosely based on a [CodeWars challenge]((https://www.codewars.com/kata/5672a98bdbdd995fad00000f/solutions/javascript)) I did in the first round.

### R2D12: October 9, 2019
Continued working on Rock, Paper, Scissors, concentrating on re-writing the Javascript part

**Thoughts:**
Still travelling so could only spend an hour, when I wanted to finish this. Ended up refactoring some of the Javascript, which I then ended up causing a bug. Got there in the end but need to now finish the CSS.

### R2D13: October 14, 2019
Continued working on the CSS part of my Rock, Paper, Scissors project

This has been a challenging few days. Travelling and working with one hand, due to me finally needing to rest a sprained wrist.

### R2D14: October 15, 2019
Finished the main CSS part of my Rock, Paper, Scissors project

**Thoughts:**
There's a couple of small things that need to be worked on, which has been frustrating to make look better.
