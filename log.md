# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Applied Visual Design part, of the Responsive Web Design Certification, on freeCodeCamp. Also completed some challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1056275257772912645

**Thoughts:** I've been on Codewars for nearly a month and I'm starting to feel a bit more confident on some of the 8 kyu challenges. Today I've completed:

1. [Reversed Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018)
2. [Do I get a bonus?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f6ad906b88de513f000d96)

### Day 2: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1056692306550681602

**Thoughts:** I wanted to to take a step back and refresh my brain some of the basics of Javascript as I feel I jumped ahead of myself in taking on challenges. I've started to find myself stuck so I started to look at the Javascript section on freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp and completed some challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1057035126004240385

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling to confident to branch out a bit more so continuing going through freeCodeCamp.

1. [Simple Fun #20: First Reverse Try](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5886c6b2f3b6ae33dd0000be)
2. [Remove First and Last Character](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56bc28ad5bdaeb48760009b0)

### Day 4: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles from the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1057406124687876099

**Thoughts:**  It's been a while since I've tackled this part of front end design, so not only was it a good refresher but I also learnt some things I wasn't aware of.

### Day 5: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid from Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1057781374910951424

**Thoughts:**  No real thoughts other than I think I was too tired when I worked on these. I feel at some point I may need to revist these to take it in properly and possibly work on a project where I can use this.

### Day 6: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Survey Form on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1058144869124837376

**Thoughts:** I opted to skip to this as I'm still trying to think of subject for the Build a Tribute Page project. I thought doing the survey first would be a good challenge as I haven't worked on coding forms to even this kind of degree. Before going through FCC, any previous knowledge was a while back. It was a good challenge to sink my teeth into.

1. Build a Survey Form [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ssrome/pen/BGBaLW) and [Github](https://github.com/ssrome/fcc_survey_form)

### Day 7: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed Bootstrap from the Front End Libraries Certification on freeCodeCamp. Also started on Build a Tribute Page from the Responsive Web Design Projects. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1058495750974435331

**Thoughts:** At some point I want to take a deeper dive into the current version Bootstrap. Though I manage to get my hour in, I didn't have enough time to make real progess on the project.

### Day 8: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Tribute Page on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1058746482650726400

**Thoughts:** My main issue was just thinking of someone to base this on. Other than that it mostly comfortable but I needed to go over a responsive elements, as part of the requirements.

1. Build a Tribute Form [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ssrome/pen/OooJzy) and [Github](https://github.com/ssrome/fcc_tribute-page)

### Day 9: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed some challenges on Codewars and worked through part of Basic JavaScript on freeCodeCamp. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1059216000225345536

**Thoughts:** I had taken a few days break from JavaScript as I felt like I was starting to get blocked on some of the challenges I was attempting. The break did me some good as I was able take a fresh approach on working on solutions.

1. [Make a function that does arithmetic!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583f158ea20cfcbeb400000a/solutions/javascript)
2. [Switch it Up!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5808dcb8f0ed42ae34000031/solutions/javascript)
3. [Convert number to reversed array of digits](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5583090cbe83f4fd8c000051/solutions/javascript)

7. [Rock Paper Scissors!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5672a98bdbdd995fad00000f/solutions/javascript)
8. [Jenny's secret message](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55225023e1be1ec8bc000390/solutions/javascript)

### Day 10: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through Basic JavaScript on freeCodeCamp and challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1059587781989752832

**Thoughts:** I was very limited on time so could only spend an hour. I'm finding it easier day-by-day to identify what methods I can use for the challenges. While I don't consistently write the solution on the first attempt, I am getting quicker in solving them.

1. [Is n divisible by x and y?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5545f109004975ea66000086/solutions/javascript)
2. [Keep Hydrated!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582cb0224e56e068d800003c/solutions/javascript)

5. [MakeUpperCase](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a0556c7cb1f31ab3000ad7/solutions/javascript)

### Day 11: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through Basic JavaScript on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1059952542325661697

**Thoughts:** Again I could only do the mininum hour. The lack of time to really get stuck into things is becoming a factor this week and I don't see it being any better before the weekend. Insted of doing it after work, and other activities, I might have to try this before work.

### Day 12: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through ES6 as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1060319920137924610

**Thoughts:** As I finished Basic JavaScript, I moved on to ES6. I found some parts confusing. Not sure if it was understanding or the way the course was writter. I will keep plowing on and will probably go over this on another site.

### Day 13: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Regular Expressions as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1060682403780481024

**Thoughts:** The only exposure to regular expression as been when a challenge has asked to remove or replace so it was good to really take a deeper view into this.

### Day 14: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Regular Expressions and Debugging as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1061041598413357059

**Thoughts:** No real thoughts other than I'm looking forward to having a bit more time so I can resume working on three outstanding Responsive Web Design Projects I need to complete.

### Day 15: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Basic Data Structures as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp and challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1061384913612689408

**Thoughts:** Was struggling a bit today. Not sure if it has anything to do with my general tiredness.

1. [Who ate the cookie?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a996e0e8520afab9000055/solutions/javascript)

### Day 16: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Basic Algorithm Scripting as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp and challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1061746683103592448

**Thoughts:** Another day, another struggle. I think my current physical and mental state of exhaustion is starting to get to me. Today I really felt like I was struggling to work out tasks. I really do have to rethink the time of the day I'm learning.

1. [Transportation on vacation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/568d0dd208ee69389d000016/solutions/javascript)
2. [My head is at the wrong end!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f699cd9400f5b7d8000b55/solutions/javascript)
3. [Basic variable assignment](https://www.codewars.com/kata/50ee6b0bdeab583673000025/solutions/javascript)

### Day 17: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars and Exercism https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1062125376309215238

**Thoughts:** The struggle continues. I came back to a challenge that I had originally started on Exercism before I committed to 100 days of code. I thought coming back to it with fresh eyes and extra knowledge would help but it hasn't. Plus I'm still struggling in general. Starting earlier in the evening didn't help my thought process. Now on to getting more sleep.

1. [Calculate Price Excluding VAT](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5890d8bc9f0f422cf200006b/solutions/javascript)
2. [Dollars and Cents](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55902c5eaa8069a5b4000083/solutions/javascript)

### Day 18: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars and Exercism https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1062486372664119296

**Thoughts:** I have hit a big massive wall. While I might have finsihed challenges on Codewars, I'm still struggling on the same Exercism challenge. A review is going to be required.

1. [How old will I be in 2099?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5761a717780f8950ce001473/solutions/javascript)
2. [Fix the Bugs (Syntax) - My First Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56aed32a154d33a1f3000018/solutions/javascript)
3. [Return Negative](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55685cd7ad70877c23000102/solutions/javascript)

### Day 19: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1062817490038857730

**Thoughts:** Using Codewars as a way to practice and feel confident writing Javascript. I've been trying to solve problems in the fewest amount of lines possible so it's easier for me to read and get use to writing cleaner code.

1. [Holiday VIII - Duty Free](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57e92e91b63b6cbac20001e5/solutions/javascript)

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Exercism and Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1063191795683733504

**Thoughts:** My confidence is starting to slowly increase. It's been a while since I last finished an Exercism challenge (before I committed to 100 days of code) so completing one made me feel good. Long may it continue. 

**Exercism:**

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1064269228398845953

**Thoughts:** Didn't seem to have as much time as I thought I would. The next few days will be challenging as I will be travelling for work and won't have access to my personal devices. I will be limited to just doing more challenges but not sure if I can log on until I'm back home.

**Today's Progress:** Working through challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1064639963139112960

**Thoughts:**
Day 1 of travelling for work. As I’m on my work laptop, and don’t have things set up on it, I’m limited to Codewars.

### Day 25: November 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1065751794767327233

**Thoughts:**
I knew it was going to be challenging over the earlier part of the week. Travelling for work meant that I didn't have control over my time so I was only able to do something for one day out of the three days I was away for. Back into the swing of things. Still haven't had enough to do anything more than these challenges.

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1066100149217316864

**Thoughts:**

**Today's Progress:** Codewars challenges and some work on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1066813713943023616

**Thoughts:** A better day coding despite the fact I wasn't feeling so great in general.

### Day 29: November 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1067194225278758912

**Thoughts:** Taking a rest from JavaScript so I can resume working on HTML and CSS based projects. I'm looking to get started soon, on some projects that I can show off the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Day 30: November 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1067925547831971840

**Thoughts:** Was unable to do any work yesterday. Today, my general tiredness, due to lack of sleep and travelling to Leicester and back to London, on the same day, took it’s toll and I struggled. Hoping for a better day tomorrow.

### Day 31: December 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1074440131623481345

**Thoughts:** It's been a couple of weeks since I have been on this challenge. I posed the question of whether I was to start a new challenge since it had been quite a while since I last coded. A response on Twitter encouraged me to resume the current challenge instead of starting again.

I did feel it took me a while to get back into the swing of things and I feel like it will take a few days for me to feel like I'm making real progress again.

### Day 32: December 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1074810935796211713

**Thoughts:** My initial plan for today was to work on some Javascript challenges but that didn't work out so I continued on the responsive projects I still need to work on. I still feel like I'm not quite up to full capacity.

### Day 33: December 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1075533150753824768 

**Thoughts:** Thought I would try to get back to doing some JavaScript challenges. A couple of the ones I picked covered things that I wasn't aware of. Not only do I need to go through more of the methods, I think I will also require a refresh to help me get back into the swing of things.

**Today's Progress:** Continued Object Oriented Programming Challenges on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Pretty much the same as the rest of the week. Going back to the fundamentals. Looking to get back to some actual projects over the break.
