# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Applied Visual Design part, of the Responsive Web Design Certification, on freeCodeCamp. Also completed some challenges on Codewars.

**Thoughts:** I've been on Codewars for nearly a month and I'm starting to feel a bit more confident on some of the 8 kyu challenges. Today I've completed:

1. [Reversed Strings] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018)
2. [Do I get a bonus?] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f6ad906b88de513f000d96)

### Day 2: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I wanted to to take a step back and refresh my brain some of the basics of Javascript as I feel I jumped ahead of myself in taking on challenges. I've started to find myself stuck so I started to look at the Javascript section on freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp and completed some challenges on Codewars.

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling to confident to branch out a bit more so continuing going through freeCodeCamp.

1. [Simple Fun #20: First Reverse Try] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5886c6b2f3b6ae33dd0000be)
2. [Remove First and Last Character] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/56bc28ad5bdaeb48760009b0)

### Day 4: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles from Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**  It's been a while since I've tackled this part of front end design, so not only was it a good refresher but I also learnt some things I wasn't aware of.

### Day 5: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid from Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**  No real thoughts other than I think I was too tired when I worked on these. I feel at some point I may need to revist these to take it in properly and possibly work on a project where I can use this.

### Day 6: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Survey Form on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I opted to skip to this as I'm still trying to think of subject for the Build a Tribute Page project. I thought doing the survey first would be a good challenge as I haven't worked on coding forms to even this kind of degree. Before going through FCC, any previous knowledge was a while back. It was a good challenge to sink my teeth into.
