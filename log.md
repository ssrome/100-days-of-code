# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued Applied Visual Design part, of the Responsive Web Design Certification, on Free Code Camp. Also completed some challenges on Codewars.

**Thoughts:** I've been on Codewars for nearly a month and I'm starting to feel a bit more confident on some of the 8 kyu challenges. Today I've completed:
-[Reversed Strings] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018)
-[Do I get a bonus?] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f6ad906b88de513f000d96)
