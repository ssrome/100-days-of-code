# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Sabrina Samuel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 22nd, Sunday, 2019].

### R2D1: September 22, 2019
Worked on Resistor Color and RNA Transcription exercises on Exercism Javascript track

**Thoughts:** These were exercises that I started during my first round but didn't finish. I found that coming back to it with fresh eyes and some different ideas. We shall see if I need to rework either of them, after mentor feedback.
