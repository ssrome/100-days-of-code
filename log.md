# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Sabrina Samuel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 22nd, Sunday, 2019].

### R2D1: September 22, 2019
Worked on Resistor Color and RNA Transcription exercises on Exercism Javascript track

**Thoughts:** These were exercises that I started during my first round but didn't finish. I found that coming back to it with fresh eyes and some different ideas. We shall see if I need to rework either of them, after mentor feedback.

### R2D2: September 23, 2019
Worked on Javascript exercises on Codewars

**Thoughts:** 
One of the exercises didn't have clear instructions so it wasn't until I ran the tests, that I understood what other things they were looking for. A bit frustrating to not have it clear enough.

1. [Square(n) Sum](https://www.codewars.com/kata/square-n-sum/javascript)
2. [Difference of Volumes of Cuboids](https://www.codewars.com/kata/difference-of-volumes-of-cuboids/javascript)
