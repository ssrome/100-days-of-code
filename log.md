# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Applied Visual Design part, of the Responsive Web Design Certification, on freeCodeCamp. Also completed some challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1056275257772912645

**Thoughts:** I've been on Codewars for nearly a month and I'm starting to feel a bit more confident on some of the 8 kyu challenges. Today I've completed:

1. [Reversed Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018)
2. [Do I get a bonus?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f6ad906b88de513f000d96)

### Day 2: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1056692306550681602

**Thoughts:** I wanted to to take a step back and refresh my brain some of the basics of Javascript as I feel I jumped ahead of myself in taking on challenges. I've started to find myself stuck so I started to look at the Javascript section on freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp and completed some challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1057035126004240385

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling to confident to branch out a bit more so continuing going through freeCodeCamp.

1. [Simple Fun #20: First Reverse Try](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5886c6b2f3b6ae33dd0000be)
2. [Remove First and Last Character](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56bc28ad5bdaeb48760009b0)

### Day 4: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles from the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1057406124687876099

**Thoughts:**  It's been a while since I've tackled this part of front end design, so not only was it a good refresher but I also learnt some things I wasn't aware of.

### Day 5: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid from Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1057781374910951424

**Thoughts:**  No real thoughts other than I think I was too tired when I worked on these. I feel at some point I may need to revist these to take it in properly and possibly work on a project where I can use this.

### Day 6: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Survey Form on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1058144869124837376

**Thoughts:** I opted to skip to this as I'm still trying to think of subject for the Build a Tribute Page project. I thought doing the survey first would be a good challenge as I haven't worked on coding forms to even this kind of degree. Before going through FCC, any previous knowledge was a while back. It was a good challenge to sink my teeth into.

1. Build a Survey Form [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ssrome/full/BGBaLW) and [Github](https://github.com/ssrome/fcc_survey_form)

### Day 7: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed Bootstrap from the Front End Libraries Certification on freeCodeCamp. Also started on Build a Tribute Page from the Responsive Web Design Projects. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1058495750974435331

**Thoughts:** At some point I want to take a deeper dive into the current version Bootstrap. Though I manage to get my hour in, I didn't have enough time to make real progess on the project.

### Day 8: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Tribute Page on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1058746482650726400

**Thoughts:** My main issue was just thinking of someone to base this on. Other than that it mostly comfortable but I needed to go over a responsive elements, as part of the requirements.

1. Build a Tribute Form [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ssrome/full/OooJzy) and [Github](https://github.com/ssrome/fcc_tribute-page)

### Day 9: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed some challenges on Codewars and worked through part of Basic JavaScript on freeCodeCamp. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1059216000225345536

**Thoughts:** I had taken a few days break from JavaScript as I felt like I was starting to get blocked on some of the challenges I was attempting. The break did me some good as I was able take a fresh approach on working on solutions.

1. [Make a function that does arithmetic!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583f158ea20cfcbeb400000a/solutions/javascript)
2. [Switch it Up!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5808dcb8f0ed42ae34000031/solutions/javascript)
3. [Convert number to reversed array of digits](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5583090cbe83f4fd8c000051/solutions/javascript)

7. [Rock Paper Scissors!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5672a98bdbdd995fad00000f/solutions/javascript)
8. [Jenny's secret message](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55225023e1be1ec8bc000390/solutions/javascript)

### Day 10: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through Basic JavaScript on freeCodeCamp and challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1059587781989752832

**Thoughts:** I was very limited on time so could only spend an hour. I'm finding it easier day-by-day to identify what methods I can use for the challenges. While I don't consistently write the solution on the first attempt, I am getting quicker in solving them.

1. [Is n divisible by x and y?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5545f109004975ea66000086/solutions/javascript)
2. [Keep Hydrated!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582cb0224e56e068d800003c/solutions/javascript)

5. [MakeUpperCase](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a0556c7cb1f31ab3000ad7/solutions/javascript)

### Day 11: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through Basic JavaScript on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1059952542325661697

**Thoughts:** Again I could only do the mininum hour. The lack of time to really get stuck into things is becoming a factor this week and I don't see it being any better before the weekend. Insted of doing it after work, and other activities, I might have to try this before work.

### Day 12: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through ES6 as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1060319920137924610

**Thoughts:** As I finished Basic JavaScript, I moved on to ES6. I found some parts confusing. Not sure if it was understanding or the way the course was writter. I will keep plowing on and will probably go over this on another site.

### Day 13: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Regular Expressions as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1060682403780481024

**Thoughts:** The only exposure to regular expression as been when a challenge has asked to remove or replace so it was good to really take a deeper view into this.

### Day 14: November 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Regular Expressions and Debugging as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1061041598413357059

**Thoughts:** No real thoughts other than I'm looking forward to having a bit more time so I can resume working on three outstanding Responsive Web Design Projects I need to complete.

### Day 15: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Basic Data Structures as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp and challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1061384913612689408

**Thoughts:** Was struggling a bit today. Not sure if it has anything to do with my general tiredness.

1. [Who ate the cookie?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a996e0e8520afab9000055/solutions/javascript)

### Day 16: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working through Basic Algorithm Scripting as part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp and challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1061746683103592448

**Thoughts:** Another day, another struggle. I think my current physical and mental state of exhaustion is starting to get to me. Today I really felt like I was struggling to work out tasks. I really do have to rethink the time of the day I'm learning.

1. [Transportation on vacation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/568d0dd208ee69389d000016/solutions/javascript)
2. [My head is at the wrong end!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f699cd9400f5b7d8000b55/solutions/javascript)
3. [Basic variable assignment](https://www.codewars.com/kata/50ee6b0bdeab583673000025/solutions/javascript)

### Day 17: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars and Exercism https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1062125376309215238

**Thoughts:** The struggle continues. I came back to a challenge that I had originally started on Exercism before I committed to 100 days of code. I thought coming back to it with fresh eyes and extra knowledge would help but it hasn't. Plus I'm still struggling in general. Starting earlier in the evening didn't help my thought process. Now on to getting more sleep.

1. [Calculate Price Excluding VAT](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5890d8bc9f0f422cf200006b/solutions/javascript)
2. [Dollars and Cents](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55902c5eaa8069a5b4000083/solutions/javascript)

### Day 18: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars and Exercism https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1062486372664119296

**Thoughts:** I have hit a big massive wall. While I might have finsihed challenges on Codewars, I'm still struggling on the same Exercism challenge. A review is going to be required.

1. [How old will I be in 2099?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5761a717780f8950ce001473/solutions/javascript)
2. [Fix the Bugs (Syntax) - My First Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56aed32a154d33a1f3000018/solutions/javascript)
3. [Return Negative](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55685cd7ad70877c23000102/solutions/javascript)

### Day 19: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1062817490038857730

**Thoughts:** Using Codewars as a way to practice and feel confident writing Javascript. I've been trying to solve problems in the fewest amount of lines possible so it's easier for me to read and get use to writing cleaner code.

1. [Holiday VIII - Duty Free](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57e92e91b63b6cbac20001e5/solutions/javascript)

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Exercism and Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1063191795683733504

**Thoughts:** My confidence is starting to slowly increase. It's been a while since I last finished an Exercism challenge (before I committed to 100 days of code) so completing one made me feel good. Long may it continue. 

**Exercism:**

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1064269228398845953

**Thoughts:** Didn't seem to have as much time as I thought I would. The next few days will be challenging as I will be travelling for work and won't have access to my personal devices. I will be limited to just doing more challenges but not sure if I can log on until I'm back home.

**Today's Progress:** Working through challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1064639963139112960

**Thoughts:**
Day 1 of travelling for work. As I’m on my work laptop, and don’t have things set up on it, I’m limited to Codewars.

### Day 25: November 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1065751794767327233

**Thoughts:**
I knew it was going to be challenging over the earlier part of the week. Travelling for work meant that I didn't have control over my time so I was only able to do something for one day out of the three days I was away for. Back into the swing of things. Still haven't had enough to do anything more than these challenges.

**Today's Progress:** Challenges on Codewars. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1066100149217316864

**Thoughts:**

**Today's Progress:** Codewars challenges and some work on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1066813713943023616

**Thoughts:** A better day coding despite the fact I wasn't feeling so great in general.

### Day 29: November 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1067194225278758912

**Thoughts:** Taking a rest from JavaScript so I can resume working on HTML and CSS based projects. I'm looking to get started soon, on some projects that I can show off the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Day 30: November 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1067925547831971840

**Thoughts:** Was unable to do any work yesterday. Today, my general tiredness, due to lack of sleep and travelling to Leicester and back to London, on the same day, took it’s toll and I struggled. Hoping for a better day tomorrow.

### Day 31: December 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1074440131623481345

**Thoughts:** It's been a couple of weeks since I have been on this challenge. I posed the question of whether I was to start a new challenge since it had been quite a while since I last coded. A response on Twitter encouraged me to resume the current challenge instead of starting again.

I did feel it took me a while to get back into the swing of things and I feel like it will take a few days for me to feel like I'm making real progress again.

### Day 32: December 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on outstanding FCC responsive web design projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1074810935796211713

**Thoughts:** My initial plan for today was to work on some Javascript challenges but that didn't work out so I continued on the responsive projects I still need to work on. I still feel like I'm not quite up to full capacity.

### Day 33: December 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript challenges on Codewars https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1075533150753824768 

**Thoughts:** Thought I would try to get back to doing some JavaScript challenges. A couple of the ones I picked covered things that I wasn't aware of. Not only do I need to go through more of the methods, I think I will also require a refresh to help me get back into the swing of things.

### Day 35: December 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Object Oriented Programming Challenges on FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1076247738814263297

**Thoughts:** Pretty much the same as the rest of the week. Going back to the fundamentals. Looking to get back to some actual projects over the break.

### Day 36: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on FreeCodeCamp, which included Functional Programming https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1078759044414873600

**Thoughts:** I have been finding it hard to continue this challenge on a consistent basis over the past few weeks. It's hard to get my head in the right space to fully concentrate and take things in.

### Day 37: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** jQuery and Sass from Front End Libraries Certification on FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1079143866106822656

**Thoughts:** Felt at ease working through these sections. I needed to step away from the Javascript challenges for a bit. Been away for a week and this will continue for another week. More likely to have more time and brain power to fully feel the benefit of what I'm learning.

### Day 38: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Began working on React Challenges from Front End Libraries Certification on FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1079489375250141186

**Thoughts:** At the company, I work for, the developers have recently been working with React so it's been good working through these challenges to start to understand how they are developing the front end of company's website.

### Day 39: December 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on React Challenges from Front End Libraries Certification on FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1079698893259051008

**Thoughts:** Still working through this and taking my time to really absorb the information in. One conclusion that I've come to is that I need to be developing little projects to show what I'm learning, even if they are just components and stop thinking I need to do a whole page.

### Day 40: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started on Build a JavaScript Calculator project and continued working on React Challenges from Front End Libraries Certification on FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1080234968473915393

**Thoughts:** I'm still taking my time to work through this part so with that in mind and wanting to do some more projects,  I thought it was a good idea to start on one of the JavaScript projects so then I test how well I've been absorbing all that I've learnt so far.

### Day 41: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on Build a JavaScript Calculator project from FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1080955372813336581

**Thoughts:** I think I have the HTML and CSS as I want it and I even included a Google Font instead of just using the standard fonts. I didn't have enough time to go into the functionality of it as I want to pick a day when I can more time to really delve into the JavaScript part of this.

### Day 42: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Random Quote Machine project and JSON APIs and Ajax from FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1082050046277890048

**Thoughts:** As I was coding the random quote machine, it was clear that that I needed to look at JSON APIs and Ajax as I hadn't covered getting data from APIs on anything I've done so far on FreeCodeCamp. I also needed to read a little bit more of other ways of grabbing data from an API as I'm not fully confident on this yet.

### Day 43: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued on Build a Random Quote Machine project from FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1082424073085435905

**Thoughts:** The jQuery was working on my local, but not via CodePen. Inspecting what the error was via the console showed that I needed to have 'https' on the API URL instead of 'http'. Though I will probably tweak the CSS, this has essentially been completed as it has passed all the tests.

### Day 44: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Resumed working on Build a Product Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1082777150183432192

**Thoughts:** Thought it was best to come back to the Responsive Web Design Projects and finally finished them off so I can complete the Responsive Web Design Certification track. I'm progressing well with the product landing page. There's a couple of things I need to focus on, in terms of the CSS but the hope is this will be another project I can tick off the list this week.

### Day 45: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Build a Product Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1083140195782930437

**Thoughts:** Felt quite good adding a Javascript function to show the current year, on my footer. I think I need to keep doing things like this to give me confidence.

### Day 46: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Build a Technical Documentation Page project from FreeCodeCamp and TypeScript 5 minutes tutorial https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1083474666348531712

**Thoughts:** Working briefly on the quick [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) tutorial was interested. It was good to get a little starter on one of the languages spoken about at work.

### Day 47: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Build a Technical Documentation Page project from FreeCodeCamp. Made a start on Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage. https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1083826010523611137

**Thoughts:** Once I picked what the documentation was on, this ended up being a very enjoyable project to code. Now working on the last of the Responsive Web Design Projects.

### Day 48: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project from FreeCodeCamp https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1084192658178887681

**Thoughts:** Yay! Finishing this means that I have completed the Responsive Web Design Certification. It felt good to see that certification and look back at all the projects. There's some big improvements needed on a couple of the projects. What I found today is that working on media queries can be frustrating but I'm getting better at it.

### Day 49: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Back to looking at React, which included coding a basic React component https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1084593288559108096

**Thoughts:** My previous work on React was on FreeCodeCamp. This time, I actually coded my first React component in preparation for the other FreeCodeCamp projects for the Front End Libraries Certification.

### Day 50: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on React on FreeCodeCamp and started a project with a colleague where I'll be coding the frontend while he codes the backend https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1084927909423390720

**Thoughts:** Started off by by doing some work grabbing data from an API. So far I've only managed to grab from one set of results. Need to expand on grabing the same key but from mutiple results.

### Day 51: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Coded some JavaScript for the project for my colleague and more React https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1085321525945876481

**Thoughts:** Was actually going work on the npm section of FreeCodeCamp, as I need to learn about this for my projects outside of this. Ran into a little trouble with the first test so need to resume that so the URL I'm using can be recognised.

### Day 52: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on one of my projects and more React https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1085685785016352768

**Thoughts:** A bit a of frustrating day but there's always going to be one.

### Day 53: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on FreeCodeCamp's Markdown Previewer project and React challenges https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1086016860582281216

**Thoughts:** I had previously done a quick React component but now I've decided to implement and work through something a little bigger. Using the Markdown Previewer project as an opportunity to get really into coding a React app. I'm also supplimenting this by looking at other resources to get into more detail about React.

### Day 54: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More on React https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1086747501804380162

**Thoughts:** Going through [Tania Rascia's blog post](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) about creating a React App as the only way I've done it locally, so far, has been loading in JavaScript libraries into the page. Now I'm going through creating a full project.

### Day 55: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on FreeCodeCamp's Markdown Previewer project and working on a personal project in React https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1087097698845712384

**Today's Progress:** Worked on React projects https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1089256108206772226

**Thoughts:** As I'm travelling and will be using a different MacBook, I was spending time setting up the projects that I wanted to work on in React. This will give me a good basis for completing a couple of small projects.

### Day 60: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on JavaScript and React https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1089658614007119872

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on my personal React project https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1097230949593554944

**Thoughts:** My issues today were not from a coding standpoint but more content. This shows me that I should go with more of a plan of what I want to show first before I'm ready to delve past the basic template of my site.

### Day 77: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on my personal React project https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1097998867004571650

**Thoughts:** Now I'm on the more complex components which requires more concentrated time than I'm able to give today. Outside of the hour on this, I did end up doing some pre-planning for a project that I will work on during my next round, by drawing up some rough designs and thoughts on how I will break it down.

### Day 78: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on my personal React project, which included troubleshooting https://twitter.com/saromsaweb/status/1098707697455771648
