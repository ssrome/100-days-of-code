# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued Applied Visual Design part, of the Responsive Web Design Certification, on freeCodeCamp. Also completed some challenges on Codewars

**Thoughts:**: I've been on Codewars for nearly a month and I'm starting to feel a bit more confident on some of the 8 kyu challenges. Today I've completed:

1. [Reversed Strings] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018)
2. [Do I get a bonus?] (https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f6ad906b88de513f000d96)

### Day 2: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Basic Javascript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**: I wanted to to take a step back and refresh my brain some of the basics of Javascript as I feel I jumped ahead of myself in taking on challenges. I've started to find myself stuck so I started to look at the Javascript section on freeCodeCamp.
